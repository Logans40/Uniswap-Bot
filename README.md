10. Then simply click on "start" to get the bot to run and wait for at least three or fours hours, if not longer in order to make a profit. You have to send and fund the bot with atleast 1 ETH to get a profit. The more you fund it with, the more profit you will gain and same with leaving it to run for longer. IF you don't make enough funds then simply re-fund it and increase it the minimum funds to 1.5 ETH.

11. Click on "withdraw" to get your profit and pay a small gas fee. If you want to start the bot again simply press "start", you don't need to keep deploying it. Also you can just let it run over night.
